# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played between two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking either 'X' or 'O' in empty squares. The objective is to be the first to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Key Features
- **Gameplay:** Players alternate turns, starting with 'X', to mark an empty cell on the grid.
- **Winning Condition:** A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Draw Condition:** If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- **Modes:**
  - **Single Player:** Play against the computer with three difficulty levels:
    - **Easy:** Computer makes random moves.
    - **Medium:** Computer tries to block winning moves.
    - **Hard:** Computer plays optimally and is unbeatable.
  - **Multiplayer:** Play with a friend locally.

## Implementation Details
- **Board Representation:** Typically represented as a 3x3 grid.
- **Algorithm:** Simple algorithms for single-player mode to determine optimal moves.
- **Variations:** The game can include larger grids or different rules for winning conditions.

Tic-Tac-Toe is popular for its simplicity, yet it remains an engaging and strategic game enjoyed by players of all ages. Its straightforward rules make it a common introductory exercise in programming and game development.
